// HISTORY:
//
// -Oct 30, 2005 
//  A CIccTagCreator singleton class has been added to provide general
//  support for dynamically creating tag classes using a tag signature.
//  Prototype and private tag type support can be added to the system
//  by pushing additional IIccTagFactory based objects to the 
//  singleton CIccTagCreator object.
