/*
  File:  createRSRPretransformCurve.cpp
 
  Contains:   Command-line app that writes to standard output a 'pre-transform'
  curve using formulae and parameters typical for a facility that
  might be trying to work with an 8-bit-TIFF pipeline that must
  handle 10-bit-log data as best it can, by some lossy compression
  and imperfectly reversible function.  This is example code;
  any facility using this will probably need to copy it and work
  to make that copy reflect the realities of their production.
